# Comarative-Analysis-Dashboard

This project is about creating a Comparative Analysis Dashboard in Microsoft Power BI to display sales data and growth rates. The dashboard compares current year sales with previous year sales and shows the year-over-year growth percentage. It also displays budgeted sales data along with budget variance percentage. The dashboard includes a Power BI Tooltip feature to display product level sales comparison and month-wise budget variance. Additionally, a sales forecast has been created.
